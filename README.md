# TwitchCR
Chrome extension that lets you read conversations between people.

### Usage
Open up a twitch streamer's page and refresh (I'll make it so you won't have to in the future). 

Click on the browser action icon in the top right of chrome. 

Wait for chat to load, then click on a user too see their messages so far, or click on a user that has @'d someone else to see their conversation between eachother. 

### notes
Currently very messy and the ui isn't very appealing, fixing it soon.
